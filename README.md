**Formula One Predictor**

This project aims to predict the best fantasy F1 team when provided with the necessary data.
You first set your 5 drivers, 2 constructors and left over budget. Then the program will generate all possible **valid** teams.
Then it will assess which teams are the best based on the following:
 - Average past points
 - Average recent past points
 - Cost
 - Amount of transfers required (from your current team)

Developed in Mar 2024.
I am implementing a more accurate ML model version that can take race data from 1950 to the present. [See More](https://github.com/Daniel-Judd-04/fantasy-f1-predictor)
